Prime Video Content Analysis Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of Prime Videoâ€™s movie and TV show catalog. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes details on titles, genres, ratings, directors, and release years. Key insights visualized in this dashboard include:

Total Movies & TV Shows: Breakdown of content type distribution.

Content by Release Year: Trends in the number of titles released over time.

Ratings Distribution: Analysis of how different content is rated.

Genre Popularity: A look into the most common genres.

Geographic Availability: Number of shows available by country.

This project demonstrates my ability to clean, transform, and visualize data using Power BI, creating actionable insights from large datasets.
